    Analyze the conversation history, focusing especially on the most recent entries:

    "{conversation_history}"

    The later entries in the list represent the most recent and relevant parts of the conversation between the user and the assistant,
    and should be given higher priority when interpreting the user's intent, especially the last instruction from the user.

    Consider the following available tools:
    {tools}

    Based on this, produce one of the following:

    - The single most appropriate tool name from the list (as a quoted string).
    - An ordered list of tool names representing a step-by-step plan (as a JSON array of quoted strings).
    - The string None (without quotes) if no tools apply.

    Output only the recommended tool name(s) or None â€” no extra explanation, quotes around None, or formatting.

  expected_output: >
    Either a single quoted tool name (e.g. "graph__create_schema"),
    a JSON array of quoted tool names (e.g. ["graph__create_schema", "graph__load_data"]),
    or None (without quotes).

    Examples:
    - "graph__create_schema"
    - ["graph__create_schema", "graph__load_data"]
    - None
