User: help me create a new graph in the db

================================== Ai Message ==================================

To help you create a new graph, I need a sample of your data to understand its structure.

Do you have sample data files (preferably in CSV or TSV format) that you would like to use to create the graph schema? If so, please provide a sample of 5‚Äì10 lines including headers.
